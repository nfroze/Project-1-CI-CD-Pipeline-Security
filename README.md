# 🛠️ Project 1: CI/CD Pipeline Security

## 1. Overview 🚀
This project demonstrates how to **secure a CI/CD pipeline** for a Node.js application by integrating **automated security checks**:
- **SCA Scanning to identify CVEs**
- **SAST Scanning to identify CWEs**
- **Secrets Scanning**

By shifting these checks left, we ensure that only secure, well-tested code is merged and potentially deployed.

---

## 2. Key Technologies 🛠
- **Node.js** ⚙️  
  - Provides the application runtime and npm package manager.
- **GitHub Actions** 🤖  
  - Automates security scans on every push or pull request.
- **Semgrep** 🔎  
  - Scans source code for CWEs (SAST).
- **npm audit** 📦  
  - Detects vulnerable dependencies (SCA).
- **Gitleaks** 🔐  
  - Flags secrets like credentials or API tokens.

---

## 3. Security Highlights 🔒
- **Early Vulnerability Detection**  
  - npm audit and Semgrep catch issues before deployment.
- **Secrets Protection**  
  - Gitleaks prevents credentials from leaking into version control.
- **Fail-Fast Pipeline**  
  - Critical issues stop the pipeline early to protect the app.

---

## 4. Workflow 🔄
1. **Trigger**: Any push or PR to `Project-1/**` triggers a GitHub Actions workflow.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Installs required npm packages.
3. **Run Scans**:
   - **Semgrep** for code-level weaknesses.
   - **npm audit** for package vulnerabilities.
   - **Gitleaks** for secrets detection.

---

## 5. Value for Organizations 💼
- **Automated Security Gates**  
  - Stops vulnerable code before it reaches production.
- **Shift-Left Enablement**  
  - Integrates security directly into the developer workflow.
- **Scalability & Reusability**  
  - Easy to replicate across Node.js-based services.
- **Auditability**  
  - GitHub Actions provides traceable security logs.

---

## 6. Conclusion ✅
By integrating **SAST**, **SCA**, and **secrets scanning** into an automated pipeline, this project shows how to implement shift-left security effectively. It enables teams to deliver **secure, high-quality code** early and often — with minimal manual effort.
